# JavaFX-Programming-Cookbook

 * Variations on the work of Andreas Pomarolli, author of JavaFX Programming Cookbook which you can find online here:
 * http://index-of.es/Varios-2/JavaFX-Programming-Cookbook.pdf
 * I was so excited to jump into JavaFX. I googled JavaFX and this was one of the first links. 
 * This book is amazing to get started and learn by doing. Thank you Andreas!
